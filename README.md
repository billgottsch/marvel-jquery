# Marvel Comic Book Hero Search!

### What does that even mean?
This project was done as an assignment follow-up to an assignment about API, JQuery and data gathering. We were to bring in the API from Marvel's Development page and create our own type of webpage using that information.

###What does it do?
I've made mine as a clean, fun and user-friendly name search to allow the specific information to be shown after a quick one-click search. You'll be able to search a full, partial or single letter and find the Super Hero you want.

I went with a fun background given an opacity and used the rest of the project's color pallet to match that image.
